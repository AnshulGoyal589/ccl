                <p>
                    Please be aware that the cancellation of your registration is not an option at Champion Cricket
                    League. We do not offer refunds at any stage of our event or league, and our refund
                    policy applies uniformly to all players. Here is the Refund Policy – Champion Cricket League
                </p>
                <h5>Refund Policy – Champion Cricket League Overview:</h5>
                <p>
                    Champion Cricket League is committed to providing all registered players with a fair and equal opportunity to
                    showcase their cricketing skills and compete at various levels. Our events and leagues require
                    careful planning, organization, and resources to ensure a high-quality experience for all
                    participants. To maintain the integrity of our registration and selection process, we follow a
                    strict no-refund policy. This means that once a player has registered and paid the required fees,
                    the payment is considered final, and no refunds will be granted under any circumstances.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Equal Treatment:
                </h5>
                <p>
                    At Champion Cricket League, we believe in maintaining fairness and equality among all our participants. This
                    includes adhering to a no-refund policy that is consistent for every player. Regardless of the
                    circumstances or reasons for cancellation, we are unable to issue refunds for any payments made for
                    our events, trials, or league matches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We understand that unforeseen situations may arise that can prevent a registered player from
                    participating, but as a sports organization, we must maintain a consistent and equitable approach
                    for all participants.
                </p>

                <b>We appreciate your interest in Champion Cricket League and your understanding of our refund policy.</b>
