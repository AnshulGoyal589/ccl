                <p>

                    I hereby declare that my parents/guardians and I have read and understood all the rules,
                    regulations, and stipulations of the Champion Cricket League, and we undertake to
                    unconditionally abide by them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is implicitly and explicitly understood and unconditionally agreed and accepted by us that the
                    decision of the coaches in the selection of players will be final and binding on us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I hereby undertake not to inject, swallow, inhale, or consume any performance-enhancing drugs and/or
                    any prohibited substance/substances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand and agree that if I am found guilty of having breached and/or violated any terms of
                    this undertaking, my registration will be immediately canceled.

                    The decision of the Disciplinary Committee of the Champion Cricket League in this regard will be final and binding
                    on me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We understand and agree that if the applicant sustains an injury during the course of the
                    camp/season and is not allowed to continue, no refund will be given to us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Champion Cricket League Management shall not be liable for the non-disclosure of any medical condition and/or
                    any injury suffered during the course of play.
                </p>


                <p>
                    In case my registration is canceled for any reason whatsoever by the Disciplinary Committee of the
                    Champion Cricket League, the registration fee paid by us will be forfeited, and we shall have no claim of any kind
                    against the Champion Cricket League management or their associates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We understand and agree that, in case the event is called off due to reasons beyond the control of
                    the Champion Cricket League management, such as riots, civil commotion, war, acts of God, orders of the court, a
                    ban by Local/State/Central Governments, etc., the registration fees paid by us will not be refunded.
                </p>


                <p>
                    It is mandatory for the parents/legal guardian to execute an Indemnity Bond on Rs. 10 Non-Judicial
